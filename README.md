### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**Landilus/Landilus** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Walmart
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about SQL
- âš¡ Fun fact: No me baÃ±o los miercoles
